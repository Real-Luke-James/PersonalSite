            <p>
                If a country member loses membership by any means from the 5JA SMP Companion Discord Server, <br>
                they can be suspended from the UIN until they regain the ability to rejoin.

                    If the country leader is banned from the 5JA SMP Companion Discord Server, <br>
                    their country is considered dissolved, and its land may be divided among other <br>
                    UIN member states.

                    In a case where they voluntarily leave the 5JA SMP Companion Discord Server,<br>
                    a UIN member state may host a vote to suspend them from the UIN under this<br>
                    section.

            <li>
                <p>
                    In a case where they are banned from the 5J Airlines Discord but not the 5JA <br>
                    SMP Companion Discord Server, a UIN member state may host a vote to <br>
                    suspend them from the UIN under this section.

                If a UIN Member Country becomes a puppet of another UIN Member Country by any <br>
                means, the puppeteer country may host a vote to absorb the puppet country’s land <br>
                during the puppetry period, but with markings denoting that it is the puppet country’s <br>
                land.

                    If the country becomes a puppet but is suspended from the UIN, the puppeteer <br>
                    country will retain all land previously on the SMP Map that was controlled by the <br>
                    puppet country.

                    If the country is a puppet and is suspended from the UIN for reasons covered in <br>
                    Chapter 1 of this resolution, the puppeteer country may host a vote to absorb the <br>
                    puppet country’s land without markings denoting the puppet country's ownership.
